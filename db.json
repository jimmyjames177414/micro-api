        "<p>I am a very passionate Application Development Senior Analyst here at Accenture. I spent three years at a software consulting company as a Software Developer prior to transferring to Accenture in 2018. While consulting, I worked professionally with a very wide variety of coding languages and have learned to adapt at the flip of a switch. Prior to consulting, I was the Lead Full-stack .NET Developer on a project under grants from Homeland Security called the Disaster Management Communication System. Creating something that would help first responders in the filed is something I'm really proud of.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>While at Accenture, I have developed numerous technologies that your self might have used!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>KX Document's PPT Slide Sorter Search:</strong> KX Document Search Widget's ability to search through the pages of a PPT document so you don't have to! <a href=\"https://kxdocuments.accenture.com/?k=artificial%20intelligence&amp;page=1&amp;0248=Yes\">LINK</a></li>\n  <li><strong>Ask @Accenture Chatbot On Portal:</strong> Originally called Omnibot, It will answer any of your Accenture related needs.
